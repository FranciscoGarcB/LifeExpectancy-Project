        <h2> Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout the entire <a href="visualizations.html"> visualizations </a> section of this 
            project we've seen many charts that need to be interpreted and analyzed
            in order to obtain important insights.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, on the <a href="visualizations.html#Schart1">map's</a> tooltips it is possible to see that,
            in general, most countries exhibit a noticeable <b>trend of increasing</b> life expectancy over the years. 
            This means that, <b>on average, people are living longer lives compared to the past</b>. <br>

            We can observe an important contrast between continents, particularly Europe and Africa. Europe generally boasts 
            higher life expectancies, while Africa tends to have lower life expectancies on average. This disparity 
            highlights significant differences in healthcare access, economic development, and living standards between 
            these regions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Last sentence can be also observed on the <a href="visualizations.html#Schart2">bar chart</a>, 
            since there are many european countries on the top 10, while the bottom 10 is almost fully 
            populated with african countries. <br>
            Bottom 10 countries has higher values on adult mortality and HIV/AIDS deaths compared to 
            top 10 countries, which <b>can be an indicator of some kind of correlation</b> between this factor 
            and the life expectancy. Similarly, it's clearly visible that top 10 countries have bigger GDP per capita
            than bottom 10 countries.
        </p>
        <p>
            Comparing groups of countries with status on the <a href="visualizations.html#Schart3">box plot</a> there is a visible gap between developed and 
            developing  countries life expectancies, but this <b>gap is slowly getting smaller through the years</b>.
            This visualization confirms that both groups average life expectancies have grown up since 2000 
            till 2015.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the <a href="visualizations.html#Schart4">bubble chart</a> we can see how much different factors relate
            to the life expectancy. <br> The default selected factor (ICR) shows clearly that <b>developing countries
            have less Human Development Index</b>, which is extremely correlated to life expectancy. <br>
            With this graph we can see that <b>consumption of alcohol seems to have no correlation with the life expectancy</b>
            of a country, it is interesting to show that developed countries tend to have a bigger consumption than 
            developing countries. <br>
        <p>
            An important factor to analyze is Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
            In general, there is a positive correlation between a country's GDP and its life expectancy. This relationship is primarily attributed to the fact 
            that higher GDP enables better access to healthcare services, improved nutrition, investments in clean water and sanitation, 
            education and public health awareness, and the reduction of poverty. However, it's important to recognize that while GDP can 
            be a contributing factor to longer life expectancy, other factors such as healthcare systems, social policies, and individual 
            behavior also play crucial roles in determining life expectancy, and there can be variations among different countries and regions.
        </p>
            As said before (and as expected), <b>a bigger probability of dying between 15 and 60 years per 1000 
            population lends to a worse life expectancy</b>.
            <br> In any of this factors the population (visualized as size of the bubbles) seems to be 
            correlated to the life expectancy.
        </p>
